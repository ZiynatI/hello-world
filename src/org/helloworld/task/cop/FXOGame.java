Alice and Bob are playing a game. They have a string 𝑠 consisting of characters X and O. Players take turns, Alice is first.
During their move, the player chooses two adjacent characters of the string and swaps them
(it is obligatory to do this, so the players cannot skip their turn; but it is allowed to choose two equal characters if they are adjacent).
Alice wins the game if, after someone's move, the string contains at least three consecutive characters X.
Bob wins the game if, after someone's move, the string contains at least three consecutive characters O.
If XXX and OOO occur at the same time, the player who made the last move wins. If the game lasts for 1337 turns and nobody wins, it ends in a tie.
Your task is to determine the result of the game if both players play optimally.

Input
The first line contains a single integer 𝑡(1≤𝑡≤500) — the number of test cases.
The only line of each test case contains a string 𝑠(3≤|𝑠|≤300), consisting of characters X and O.
Additional constraint on the input: among every three consecutive characters in 𝑠, there is at least one X and at least one O.
Output
For each test case, print the result of the game if both players play optimally.
If Alice wins, print "Alice". If Bob wins, print "Bob". If it's a tie, print "Tie".*/
