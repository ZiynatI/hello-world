A permutation of length 𝑛 is an array of 𝑛 elements, where each element from 1 to 𝑛 appears exactly once.
An element of an array is called a record, if at least one of the following conditions is satisfied:
    it is the first element;
    it is greater than every element before it;
    it is smaller than every element before it.
For example, the array [3,5,5,4,6,2,7,2,1] contains 6 records (they are bolded).
An array is spectacular if every element in it is a record.
You are given an integer 𝑛. You have to calculate the number of spectacular permutations of length 𝑛.
Input
The first line contains one integer 𝑡(1≤𝑡≤50) — the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of one line containing one integer 𝑛(1≤𝑛≤50).
Output
For each test case, print one integer — the number of spectacular permutations of length 𝑛.
Example
Input
1
3

Output
4

Note

For 𝑛=3, the following permutations are spectacular:
    [1,2,3];
    [2,1,3];
    [2,3,1];
    [3,2,1]. */
