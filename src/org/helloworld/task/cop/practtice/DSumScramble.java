//There was a sequence of 𝑛
//integers 𝑎1,𝑎2,…,𝑎𝑛. From it, another sequence 𝑏1,𝑏2,…,𝑏𝑛 was constructed: 𝑏𝑖 equals the sum of digits in 𝑎𝑖
//
//.
//
//Two sequences were merged together and shuffled. The result is a sequence 𝑐1,𝑐2,…,𝑐2𝑛
//
//.
//
//You are given the sequence 𝑐
//. Find any possible initial sequence 𝑎
//
//.
//
//If there are multiple answers, print any of them.
//Input
//
//The first line contains a single integer 𝑡
//(1≤𝑡≤100
//
//) — the number of test cases.
//
//The first line of each test case contains a single integer 𝑛
//(1≤𝑛≤100) — the number of elements in 𝑎
//
//.
//
//The second line contains 2𝑛
//integers 𝑐1,𝑐2,…,𝑐2𝑛 (1≤𝑐𝑖≤109
//
//).
//
//The tests are constructed in such a way that there exists a sequence 𝑎
//that can produce the given sequence 𝑐
//
//.
//Output
//
//For each test case, print 𝑛
//integers — the elements of the sequence 𝑎 such that it can produce the given sequence 𝑐
//
//.
//
//If there are multiple answers, print any of them.
